# Closures and Decorators in Python

This repository provides an explanation and examples of closures and decorators in Python. These concepts are powerful and widely used in Python programming for different purposes.

## Closures

Closures in Python are functions that remember and have access to variables from their enclosing scope even after that scope has finished executing. They allow functions to retain information and maintain state. In this repository, you will find simple and practical examples of closures that demonstrate how they can be used to create functions that remember certain values or maintain state.

## Decorators

Decorators in Python are functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions without directly changing their source code. They provide a way to add extra functionality or modify the behavior of a function by wrapping it with another function. In this repository, you will find clear and practical examples of decorators that showcase how they can be used to add authentication, logging, or timing functionality to existing functions.
